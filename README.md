This project showcases an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the global COVID-19 pandemic using SQL, combined with interactive Power BI visualizations to illustrate the isights. 

projecct Objective :

1. Understand the global and region trends in the spread of COVID-19 through detailed analysis of confirmed cases and deaths and recoveries.
2. Calculate mortality and recovery rates.
3. Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on various countries and regions and compare trends between them.
4. Create interactive visualization that allow users to filter data by country, time period, and other variables to derive their own insights.

   Tools and Technology Used:

   SQL: Used for data cleaning (handling missing and incomplete records), aggregation, analysis.

   Power BI: Used for creating interactive and dynamic visualization.
